### Project:

A fully-responsive product landing page for the Free Code Camp responsive web design certification

### The Problem:

Create a one-page "Product Landing Page" for a chosen product in the style of [this site](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/RKRbwL).
  
* Must complete a series of [user stories](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-product-landing-page)

* Must be aesthetically pleasing, mobile friendly, and use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

### Why Photography? Are these your photos?

These are all actually my photos. I've adored photography ever since I started using my discount Nikon DSLR. I especially love taking landscapes and do a lot of travel photography. I've also used my photography skills to better understand Social Media Management like experiments in optimizing Instagram. [My Instagram Page](https://www.instagram.com/1000goldenhighways/) got up to 1200 followers in a few months. I look forward to getting back to working on it again when I get the time.

### Technologies Used:

HTML, CSS, JavaScript

### Future upgrades:

Because I built this mobile first and have only recently started viewing it on larger desktops, I definitely see room for improvement in styling at larger screen sizes. Yikes.
